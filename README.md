# LIBRARY WEBSITE
# Description
This is an online library that our users can read, upload and share their documents like books, comics, sample reports,... to other users with different topics. Moreover, we can give the reviews for the current document.  

We created this website by using Django Framework, which is one of the most popular web-developing frameworks using Python.

This project is created in study purpose only. Thus, we decided to develop some basic features like create, update or delete in Database management only. This website will not have such an awesome feature like many large scale projects. Furthermore, our UI/UX designing haven't had good optimization for user's experiences. However, we still considering if we continue to develop this project or not. If we are in good condition, we may continue our works.
